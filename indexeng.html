								<p align=justify>We offer counseling oriented to dining teams of public or private schools and afterschool projects that want to approach or deepen in a respectful accompaniment towards the children, the families and the team itself.</p>
								
								<p><center><i>Kun Koro means "with heart" in Esperanto. For us it represents accompanying from the heart, from a meaningful place, from the needs of the children, the bond and the affection.</i></center></p>
								
								<p align=justify>We have been working for years in the lunchtime of the public school <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a>. When the school opened its doors, offering a loving and respectful accompaniment to the needs of the children in a public school environment, the need to take care of the non-lective, such as the lunchtime, was also revealed. This meant reflecting on some normalized situations in most schools such as forcing children to eat certain amounts or food, having to nap, rewarding or punishing certain behaviors, eating together in a large dining room, etc.</p>
								<p align=justify>Little by little we forged a noon project more respectful of the needs and rhythms of the children, which is constantly evolving. Our experience and learnings has allowed us to develop an observation capacity and a methodology that we think may be of interest for other projects that consider a more respectful accompaniment.</p>

								<h2 class="major">We Offer</h2>

								<p align=justify>We work on the needs of each project and its interests, offering observation, reflections, experiences and proposals according to each educational and dining project. We accompany the projects so that they can try to cover more the needs of the children.</p>

								<p><b>We divide the content into three basic sections:</b></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Acompañamiento.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>· Emotional accompaniment and attitudes of the accompanying adult</p>
								<p align=justify>We observe possible improvements and shortcomings in how we relate to the environment and the children as accompanying adults during meals and throughout the midday fringe. We offer training, reflections and experiences to work in this direction.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Logistica.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>· Logistics at the service of the needs of children</p>
								<p align=justify>We study the logistics of the interested project and detect possible logistical changes that could have a positive impact on the children.
								Spaces, materials or proposals available, short waiting times, how many adults are in the space and how they are located, are some of the most obvious issues. However, it is also indirectly possible from the logistics to benefit the children, through achieving more well-being in the companions, families, teachers and fellow children.
								In relation to these issues we contribute our experience and elaborate proposals for improvement at a logistic level based on what we observed and the needs and demands of the interested project.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Espacios.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>· Spaces and materials. Means for the relationship</p>
								<p align=justify>We bring our experience in terms of the layout of the spaces, their use and their materials, so that together with the logistics and the accompaniment, they create a lunchtime that is as pleasant, respectful and as rich as possible for children and adults alike.</p>

								<p align=justify><i><center>If you want to request counseling or that we add you to our mailing list, send us a word to: <a href="mailto:info@kunkoro.kiwi"><i>info@kunkoro.kiwi</i></a></i></center></p>

						<!-- Equipo -->
							<article id="Equipo">

								<h2 class="major">Team</h2>
								<p align=justify>Around 2015 we began to feel, along with companions of <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a>, the desire to share the experience that accompaning midday in this school meant for us. We began to assess the possibility of contributing what we learned to other projects that seek a specific accompaniment for the midday project. Thus, in 2018 we, Elina and Noel started working on that and Kun Koro took shape.</p>

								<p><b>Noel Cresencio González</b></p>

								<p>Child companion. Psychomotorist Therapist in training</p>

								<p align=justify>I started my training in film, photography and acting, although I was always in touch with the world of personal growth and education, due to the personal and professional career of my parents. This influence and my own interests led me to work in <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a> in the midday, since April 2011. Soon after, I joined the team to support the teachers and I was able to deepen my work and tackle new learning.</p>
								<p align=justify>I have also worked as an assistant psychomotor therapist, with Verónica Antón in <a href="https://sendabcn.com/"target="_blank">Senda</a>, accompanying several groups of children. This experience allowed me to get closer to the therapeutic aspect of the psychomotor skills of B. Aucouturier and to learn together with Verónica. These are my main sources of experience with children, through which I continue to learn day by day how to accompany them to provide what they need.</p>
								<p align=justify>I have been trained in Conscious Communication courses with <a href="https://laligera.wordpress.com/quienes-somos/"target="_blank">Chema Irusta</a>, Emotional Accompaniment, Aggressiveness and Conflicts in <a href="https://sendabcn.com/"target="_blank">Senda</a>, and Seitai in <a href="https://www.espaido.com/?lang=es"target="_blank">Espaidó</a>. I have also completed the annual formations of <a href="https://caiev.com"target="_blank">Alive and Active education</a> with Jordi Mateu, Preventive Aucouturier Psychomotor Practice in the <a href="http://www.aecassociacio.org/es/"target="_blank">AEC</a>, the annual training of the living and active school <a href="https://www.elroure.org/"target="_blank">El Roure</a> and currently the therapeutic training course of 5 years of Psycho-Body Integration, in <a href="http://psico-corporal.com/"target="_blank">ETIP</a>.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Elina.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p><b>Elina Acosta</b></p>

								<p>Graduated in Education.</p>

								<p align=justify>Since the year 2000 I felt called to explore areas that would approach the relationships between people. I started my studies in Argentina where I made an intense and diverse journey between psychology, dramatic art and theology. These branches made me connect with human relationships and the multiple paths we approach to get closer or away from each other. In 2013, already located in Barcelona, I finished my undergraduate studies in children's education at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.</p><p align = justify> These years of studies aroused a huge interest in different pedagogies. Before finishing my degree, in 2011, I contacted the public school <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a>, since I was interested in learning and sharing experiences about the alive and active education. That's how I started the path as a volunteer and then joined the school's midday team, which I currently coordinate. The experience of these years in the school, both as a volunteer, as a midday companion and as an educator in the lective period, has moved me to form myself with Verónica Antón (<a href = "https://sendabcn.com/" target = "_ blank">Senda</a>) in the emotional accompaniment and in projects of alive and active pedagogy, also with <a href="http://www.verpensarsentir.es/"target="_blank">Jenny Silvente</a> in the game with minimons (small-worlds). I am currently doing studies at <a href="https://www.peretarres.org/"target="_blank">Pere Tarrés</a> to obtain the title of director of <i>lleure</i>.</p>
