								<p align=justify>We offer counseling oriented to dining teams of public or private schools and afterschool projects that want to approach or deepen in a respectful accompaniment towards the children, the families and the team itself.</p>
								
								<p><center><i>Kun Koro means "with heart" in Esperanto. For us it represents accompanying from the heart, from a meaningful place, from the needs of the children, the bond and the affection.</i></center></p>
								
								<p align=justify>We have been working for years in the lunchtime of the public school <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a>. When the school opened its doors, offering a loving and respectful accompaniment to the needs of the children in a public school environment, the need to take care of the non-lective, such as the lunchtime, was also revealed. This meant reflecting on some normalized situations in most schools such as forcing children to eat certain amounts or food, having to nap, rewarding or punishing certain behaviors, eating together in a large dining room, etc.</p>
								<p align=justify>Little by little we forged a noon project more respectful of the needs and rhythms of the children, which is constantly evolving. Our experience and learnings has allowed us to develop an observation capacity and a methodology that we think may be of interest for other projects that consider a more respectful accompaniment.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Counseling</h2>

								<p align=justify>We offer counseling oriented to dining teams of public or private schools and afterschool projects that want to approach or deepen in a respectful accompaniment towards the children, the families and the team itself.</p>

								<p align=justify>We work on the needs of each project and its interests, offering observation, reflections, experiences and proposals according to each educational and dining project. We accompany the projects so that they can try to cover more the needs of the children.</p>

								<p><b>We divide the content into three basic sections:</b></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Acompañamiento.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>· Emotional accompaniment and attitudes of the accompanying adult</p>
								<p align=justify>We observe possible improvements and shortcomings in how we relate to the environment and the children as accompanying adults during meals and throughout the midday fringe. We offer training, reflections and experiences to work in this direction.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Logistica.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>· Logistics at the service of the needs of children</p>
								<p align=justify>We study the logistics of the interested project and detect possible logistical changes that could have a positive impact on the children.
								Spaces, materials or proposals available, short waiting times, how many adults are in the space and how they are located, are some of the most obvious issues. However, it is also indirectly possible from the logistics to benefit the children, through achieving more well-being in the companions, families, teachers and fellow children.
								In relation to these issues we contribute our experience and elaborate proposals for improvement at a logistic level based on what we observed and the needs and demands of the interested project.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Espacios.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>· Spaces and materials. Means for the relationship</p>
								<p align=justify>We bring our experience in terms of the layout of the spaces, their use and their materials, so that together with the logistics and the accompaniment, they create a lunchtime that is as pleasant, respectful and as rich as possible for children and adults alike.</p>

								<b><p align=justify><center><i>Despite the fact that the text is written in the present tense, this is an unopened and under construction project, so all information about The Club is currently just an indication. Whenever it is economically sustainable and logistically possible, we will try to adjust to this project proposal. Everything is subject to modifications.

								<b><p align=justify><center><i>The images are computer made renders. They do not represent a real space and its function is to guide and convey a general idea about the type of space we propose.</i></center></p></b>

								<p><center><br /></center></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/Vista Aerea-min.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p><b>· What is The Kun Koro Club?</b></p>

								<p align=justify>It is a center in the neighborhood of La Sagrera in Barcelona, ​​accompanied by adults, for teenagers and preteens at noon and afternoon, which arises to respond to the need for teenage girls and boys to have their own space outside their house in which to be able to interact with their friends, do their homework, study together, carry out activities or workshops, play, rest, etc. It is, for example, an alternative place to the park, for when it is no longer interesting, or for when family logistics do not allow them to meet friends at home, when the family is not available in the afternoon or for when they need to open up to the world beyond what the family nucleus can offer.</p>

								<p align=justify>We consider it very important to have moments of calm and emptiness in the everyday routine, where the things that most nourish us in relationships and in our interests, learning, knowledge of others and self-knowledge can flourish. In short, important moments for personal development. At The Kun Koro Club we take care of these moments, which we often need to become aware of our needs and seek their satisfaction, and we accompany them from a deep respect, generating a relationship of trust with the girls and boys of The Club.</p>								

								<p align=justify>We greatly appreciate the need for sharing among equals of teenagers, and with adults accompanying the space as a way of learning and enjoyment. We also always look for ways to adapt the space and accompaniment to the needs of each person and each moment.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/El Club_Studio-11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p><b>· Why do we offer this space?</b></p>

								<p align=justify>We believe that this age is extremely important and delicate and we find there’s a lack of spaces that make it easy for adolescents to live their personal processes and that really meet their needs. We provide a deep insight into adolescence and an involved, respectful accompaniment and the intent to make adolescence as pleasant and interesting for boys and girls as possible.</p>

								<p align=justify>The team of adults, with experience in respectful accompaniment and with a broad knowledge about the needs of kids and teenagers, offer a secure framework for communication - essential in this age - and complicity with adults who can also take care of them when they need to have moments and spaces outside the family.</p>

								<p><b>A second house</b></p>

								<p align=justify>We consider it essential that the space’s main use it’s the by the teenagers of The Club, thus avoiding having to use multipurpose spaces to assemble and disassemble, where you cannot leave a mark or alter the space. Prioritizing this use allows adolescents to make it theirs and those decision-making processes on agreements, spaces, activities or materials are more consistent and can be accompanied from a more careful place using more inclusive group management systems.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/El Club_Studio-12.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p><b>Accompaniment</b></p>

								<p align=justify>Giving time and space to girls and boys with a reduced ratio and respectful accompaniment makes it easy for them to feel their independence - so desired and necessary for their development stage.</p>

								<p align=justify>The Club makes available to girls and boys materials, tools, knowledge, contacts, activities, spaces and the necessary adult accompaniment so that they can develop their own interests, discover new horizons, test, experiment, investigate, reflect, discuss, rest, relax, study, do homework, create various projects, etc.</p>

								<p align=justify>In general, the dynamics of The Club have to do with individual and group needs and the conflicts that arise. There is space to reflect, negotiate and reach agreements, collaborate and share, for example, new studying techniques, tools for different life contexts, particular solutions to diverse problems, etc.</p>

								<p align=justify>We accompany the girls and boys so that they can develop their own resources in terms of responsibilities, autonomy and agreements and we are present to manage the eventual contrast between their needs or desires and the reality that does not always satisfy them. We accompany them to develop the perception of their own needs and those of their environment, generate spaces for dialogue and expression, listening, playing, critical spirit, sharing logistic tasks and feeling time freely.</p>

								<p align=justify>We also appreciate that they have moments of company with quality and consistency. It’s important that they can develop relationships between equals fluid and consistent with their moment in their development and that they can also have consistent relationships with adults who feel close and who they can trust - in addition to the family -, who leave space for themselves but are really available for what and when they need.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/El Club Terraza 2-min.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p align=justify>In both relationships (between equals and with adults) we want to foster communication and trust so that they can feel calm when asking for help with what they need, sharing studying methods, talking about each other's relationships, concerns or joys, developing in groups ideas and projects, talking and reflecting on issues that interest them, etc. The adults of the center accompany each boy and girl both in relationships with others and with themselves, as well as in sharing their own learnings and interests and those of others.</p>

								<p align=justify>The process that takes place at The Kun Koro Club is a way of life without the pressure of leaving previous stages of their childhood behind or the demand to meet requirements for the new stages. A unique experience and different for each girl and boy and that we take care of adapting fluidly according to the person, their moment and their situation. We observe and reflect on the group and each boy and girl, and we grow as a group naturally, enjoying the shared path, together.</p>

								<p align=justify>We also offer a secure framework for families. In a first interview, we discuss all possible concerns and peculiarities of each case, and we establish common agreements according to the thoughts and feelings of the family and ours, in relation to their son or daughter and their activities and uses of The Club, as well as nuances of our accompaniment as adults of the center.</p>

								<p align=justify>We consider the triangular work between the girls and boys, the adults of The Club and the family of extreme importance. Sometimes we make appointments with families, just as they can ask us for meetings whenever they need it. We aim to make a coherent accompaniment that is within that of the family and that can offer more security and depth to boys and girls.</p>

								<p align=justify>In addition to the accompaniment in the center, we also offer babysitting and escort services to boys and girls when they walk on the street to other places.</p>











								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/ArticulosClub.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p align=justify>Here are some articles and writings that are related to adolescence and the purpose of this space.</p>

								<p><li><a href="#LaEdadOlvidada" target="_blank"><i><b>The Forgotten Age</b></i></a></li><b>Begoña González, coordinator of the alive school El Roure.</b> "I think it is a pending responsibility to generate open spaces for adolescents [...] where they can get the listening they need and demand, being protagonists of their own learning and maturation processes, following their own rhythm and manner, without being judged by their search attempts".</p>

Professor of the Department of Didactics and Educational Organization of the University of Barcelona and Remei Arnaus Morral, 2019. Retired professor of the Department of Didactics and Educational Organization of the University of Barcelona.</b><p> "We understand what's important is a space in which they can have the time, calmness with respect to external pressures, relationships and reflections to discover themselves, to recognize and clarify their desires, and to explore who they are, who they want to be and what paths they want to try to find their sense of self and their direction in life".</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/El Club_Terrace-25.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p><b>· Spaces, materials and activities</b></p>

								<p align=justify>The management of a space like The Kun Koro Club is very complex due to the variety of activities and needs and therefore we propose diverse resources. From our experience and with the continuous training we carry out, we feel it is important to offer a favorable environment for the integral development of girls and boys, an environment in which they can meet their evolutionary needs and develop skills of all kinds. In The Club we accompany real situations, learning to adapt and reinvent ourselves as necessary in the changing daily life, at work, at school and in all areas of socio-educational type.</p>

								<p align=justify>The composition of the spaces is designed to meet multiple needs: for a few people or many at the same time, for several types of activities at the same time without disturbing each other, and for the same activities carried out in different ways in different spaces.</p>

								<p align=justify>The space is full of possibilities thanks to the multiple sofas, carpets, stools, armchairs, low and high tables, chairs, poufs, cushions, hammocks, etc. This allows multiple uses of furniture and possibilities of space transformation, being able, for example, to read, study, do homework, write or chat and reflect in any place and any way the boys and girls feel like. The type of furniture encourages relationships but, at the same time, does not preclude the isolation that they sometimes need.</p>

								<p align=justify>We have books, games, basic study and work office supplies, portable devices with internet, some musical instruments and other artistic materials, etc. We also have other materials that are a reflection of the interests of the girls and boys of The Club at all times. This aims to facilitate the conquest of knowledge that concerns them, either through small consultations at their disposal or large projects.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/El Club_Studio-13.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p><b>List of subspaces and their meaning</b></p>

								<p align=justify>- A space to propose ideas and make group decisions: here they can ask for materials, propose projects to be carried out and make decisions. We use group facilitation tools for inquiring about the various voices and collective feelings, as well as for group decision making, which takes into account all people, not just the louder majority. This place also approaches the possibility of venturing into unknown subjects, seeing the interests of others through their propositions.</p>

								<p align=justify>- Library: a place to discover a selection of varied books of high quality, magazines, documentaries, movies, music, board games and selected and interesting video games.</p>

								<p align=justify>- Quiet space: a place that will be available whenever someone needs it and where a calm environment is guaranteed.</p>

								<p align=justify>- Garden: the space extends to the outside following the same style of materials, furniture and uses of the space. Our little piece of open air, sun, water, plants and sky.</p>

								<p align=justify>- Tearoom: to be able to drink teas, eat snacks, eat lunch or even have dinner bringing food from home, outside or catering. There’s a fridge and various utensils.</p>

								<p align=justify>- Cabinets and coat racks: storage for backpacks, skateboards, coats, etc.</p>

								<p align=justify>- Restroom with shower: available for showering at The Club.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/El Club_Studio-17.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p><b>Proposals and workshops</b></p>

								<p align=justify>The proposals and workshops arise from observations of accompanying adults and families or the interests of the boys and girls of The Club.</p>

								<p align=justify>The accompanying adults observe and from there propose specific activities at specific times. Girls and boys may or may not be interested in these proposals freely. In this way, the proposals are part of the fluid activity of the space, unlike the workshops.</p>

								<p align=justify>Some proposals may be to compose songs, design and make clothes, watch movies or documentaries with subsequent gatherings, talk about specific topics, read and share impressions, accompaniment to do homework or study, etc.</p>

								<p align=justify>The workshops are usually more closed, we notify them in advance, and they must commit to attend. They have a more defined duration, coexist with the fluid activity of the space and can sometimes be offered on weekends. The workshops can be facilitated by an adult from Kun Koro, a boy, girl or group from The Club or external adults who collaborate with Kun Koro. Whenever possible, the workshops are included in the subscriptions, but in some cases they require an extra payment.</p>

								<p align=justify>Some possible workshops are talks with outsiders, initiation to professions (carpentry, jewelry and metals, sewing, bakery, etc.), outings and excursions (including weekends), study monographs to prepare exams or projects, etc.</p>

								<p align=justify>In short, it is about offering a space that responds to their needs for peer relationships and with trusted adults and their needs for discovery, while accommodating those moments of emptiness or rest that are so necessary at times. to find what really moves us.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/El Club_Studio-16.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p><b>· General operation</b></p>

								<p align=justify>We have several monthly subscriptions with different rates. Each boy or girl is signed up to The Kun Koro Club with the subscription that best suits their needs.</p>

								<p align=justify>We also offer a trial period in which the boy or girl can come to The Club to meet us and feel if they want to be part. In parallel, the family can meet with the accompanying adults.</p>

								<p><b>· Management of people invited to the Kun Koro Club</b></p>

								<p align=justify>Each boy or girl of The Club can invite a person for 5 days a month. The invited person cannot come without the girl or boy that invites them to The Club.</p>

								<p align=justify>We want to offer flexibility and at the same time simplicity in our rates. Therefore, we have designed three: Complete, Partial and Minimum. All rates include the use and consumption of everything available in the space, with possible limitations that have to do with the sustainability of the project or prior agreements with families.</p>

								<p align=justify>We want to promote the Full or Partial rate, since we consider it convenient for girls and boys to feel and improvise in their free time when they need or want to use the space, just as they could decide to go to the park or have a drink.</p>

								<h2 class="major">The Forgotten Age</h2>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/Edad1.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>Adolescence is a forgotten and somewhat cursed age; the idea that, socially and in general, we have on it is loaded with negativity: it is a difficult, conflicting stage, adolescents are dispersed, lazy, uncollaborative, incomprehensible, arrogant, narcissistic, rebellious, emotionally unstable, etc. Adults are often overwhelmed by adolescent energy, then the frustration appears, lack of communication and control, prohibition or punishment are established as coexistence strategies.</p>
								<p>Curiously enough, each adult has been a teenager and we can connect with our experience at that stage, to know through what we have lived, what we needed at the time, what was important for us and what limited us or hindered our growth. All of that can be inspiring when it comes to understanding other teenagers, today's teenagers.</p> 
								<p>As kids, to obtain emotional security, we need the unconscious image that adults know what should be done and do so, therefore, they are not wrong. In addition, we need their recognition and approval, their love, for what their are our models are which we follow and imitate. According to my personal experience and my observation as an education professional, in adolescence that unconscious image of adults sinks, more or less suddenly. The childlike fantasy of the “perfect adult world” that we had in childhood, disappears.</p>
								<p>Upon reaching preadolescence, a huge evolutionary change begins, the whole organism is put into action to generate the transition from childhood to adulthood, a fundamental transition in the life of anyone. That convulsive revolution is adolescence. We begin to have some emotional autonomy and greater capacity to be aware of our reality and that of others, because the emotional security that comes from the adult is no longer so necessary.</p> 
								<p>The adult and his world begin to appear in sight more broadly, with its negative aspect included; their mistakes, inconsistencies and weaknesses. There is a greater capacity to see globality and to objectify and at the same time the vision is very conditioned by the connection and the emotional bond established with adults. The look towards adults is very selective, often radical, which usually shows adults who are rejected and adults who are worshiped.</p> 
								<p>The world appears as a place to discover, beyond the family environment and its values. Before that unlimited awakening, the teenager closes his eyes and evades or questions and rebels, wants to change the world. It is a vulnerable and delicate stage, in which there is a deep desire for freedom, to explore the unknown, often touching the limits established by the family or society. Everything is possible with the overflowing adolescent energy and at the same time there is nothing more than the present moment and its intensity, be that of enjoyment or that of anguish.</p>  
								<p>Awareness of oneself is much greater and a complex process of conscious construction of identity begins; that is, I begin to wonder who I am and who I want to be. To be aware of themselves, teenagers need to distinguish themselves from the mother and father, distance themselves from them, reaffirm their difference. They need to create an image of themselves, look for models outside the family, belong to the peer group intensely to feel complicity in standing before such a task ahead.</p>
								<p>I believe that it is a pending responsibility to generate open spaces for adolescents that can contribute to a deeply fruitful experience, both for the adolescents themselves and for their families; spaces where the listening they need and demand can be given, being protagonists of their own learning and maturation processes, following their own rhythm and manner, without being judged by their search attempts.</p> 
								<p>I imagine these spaces as meeting places where teenagers are able to invest their energy, express it and channel it in a positive way, either towards themselves or towards others. That requires a conscious and respectful adult accompaniment, tuned between professionals and family. An accompaniment like this implies for adults an invitation to leave the dualistic beliefs that contrast work and leisure, learning and fun, which associate action with learning and passivity with the loss of time, etc. and allow the flow of life to be expressed, with its fluidity and movement, with its diversity of aspects. It also means attending to the tensions, blockages and difficulties that are manifested and that limit this vital flow, both individually and in groups.</p>
								<p>Adolescence is essential as a crossroads to adult life. That is why I think it is essential to create this type of support spaces for adolescents and their families, in which the meaning and needs of this crucial stage are deeply understood, in general, so misunderstood and neglected.</p>

								<h2 class="major">New Spaces</h2>
								<h2 class="major">For Adolescence</h2>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Club/Nuevos1.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>We think that the proposal you make is attractive and necessary. It is important to open a space for these ages, with heart, with listening and attention to their needs.</p>
								<p>A space beyond the school, and that can meet the dimensions and needs of their development, of their formation that has other characteristics to which the school can no longer respond, because it escapes its purpose.</p> 
								<p>A space like the one you propose is necessary, because at an age when girls and boys begin to detach themselves from their family models and seek other relationships, sometimes they find themselves in a vacuum between more normalized school spaces, and the relationships that are exploring outside the family and the guardianship of adults.</p>
								<p>In addition to this is the difficulty to dispose of a place, a physical environment, other than the family home, but not just the street.</p> 
								<p>That is why we think it is important to have a physical and relational space, attended by respectful adults, who are neither the school nor the family, and that can open up new possibilities for experience. An environment in which adults are present, but not on them at all times. Adults who are neither mothers nor fathers, neither teachers.</p> 
								<p>The art here in knowing how to create and take care of that new place that is neither school nor family, but where there is the possibility of a meeting, of adults of reference and of new possibilities of relationship and activity. And there, it is essential to have two people like you, with experience, with training and sensitivity to capture the environments and their needs and to know how to be adults of reference who are neither teachers nor family.</p>  
								<p>We believe that the meaning of your space in question is not to support the adaptive capacity of young people to the world they are imposing on us, but that they can find the deep meaning of what moves them internally as meaning and yearning for life; to be committed to life and the world. It is not the sense of adapting, but of connecting with their deep inner sense that guides them. We understand that the important thing is a space where they can have time, calmness with respect to external pressures, relationships and reflections to discover themselves, to recognize and clarify their desires, and to explore who they are, who they want to be and what paths they want to try to find their sense of self and their direction in life.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Team</h2>
								<p align=justify>Around 2015 we began to feel, along with companions of <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a>, the desire to share the experience that accompaning midday in this school meant for us. We began to assess the possibility of contributing what we learned to other projects that seek a specific accompaniment for the midday project. Thus, in 2018 we, Elina and Noel started working on that and Kun Koro took shape.</p>

								<p><b>Noel Cresencio González</b></p>

								<p>Child companion. Psychomotorist Therapist in training</p>

								<p align=justify>I started my training in film, photography and acting, although I was always in touch with the world of personal growth and education, due to the personal and professional career of my parents. This influence and my own interests led me to work in <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a> in the midday, since April 2011. Soon after, I joined the team to support the teachers and I was able to deepen my work and tackle new learning.</p>
								<p align=justify>I have also worked as an assistant psychomotor therapist, with Verónica Antón in <a href="https://sendabcn.com/"target="_blank">Senda</a>, accompanying several groups of children. This experience allowed me to get closer to the therapeutic aspect of the psychomotor skills of B. Aucouturier and to learn together with Verónica. These are my main sources of experience with children, through which I continue to learn day by day how to accompany them to provide what they need.</p>
								<p align=justify>I have been trained in Conscious Communication courses with <a href="https://laligera.wordpress.com/quienes-somos/"target="_blank">Chema Irusta</a>, Emotional Accompaniment, Aggressiveness and Conflicts in <a href="https://sendabcn.com/"target="_blank">Senda</a>, and Seitai in <a href="https://www.espaido.com/?lang=es"target="_blank">Espaidó</a>. I have also completed the annual formations of <a href="https://caiev.com"target="_blank">Alive and Active education</a> with Jordi Mateu, Preventive Aucouturier Psychomotor Practice in the <a href="http://www.aecassociacio.org/es/"target="_blank">AEC</a>, the annual training of the living and active school <a href="https://www.elroure.org/"target="_blank">El Roure</a> and currently the therapeutic training course of 5 years of Psycho-Body Integration, in <a href="http://psico-corporal.com/"target="_blank">ETIP</a>.</p>

								<p><b>Elina Acosta</b></p>

								<p>Graduated in Education.</p>

								<p align=justify>Since the year 2000 I felt called to explore areas that would approach the relationships between people. I started my studies in Argentina where I made an intense and diverse journey between psychology, dramatic art and theology. These branches made me connect with human relationships and the multiple paths we approach to get closer or away from each other. In 2013, already located in Barcelona, I finished my undergraduate studies in children's education at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.</p><p align = justify> These years of studies aroused a huge interest in different pedagogies. Before finishing my degree, in 2011, I contacted the public school <a href="http://escolacongresindians.com/"target="_blank">Congrés-Indians</a>, since I was interested in learning and sharing experiences about the alive and active education. That's how I started the path as a volunteer and then joined the school's midday team, which I currently coordinate. The experience of these years in the school, both as a volunteer, as a midday companion and as an educator in the lective period, has moved me to form myself with Verónica Antón (<a href = "https://sendabcn.com/" target = "_ blank">Senda</a>) in the emotional accompaniment and in projects of alive and active pedagogy, also with <a href="http://www.verpensarsentir.es/"target="_blank">Jenny Silvente</a> in the game with minimons (small-worlds). I am currently doing studies at <a href="https://www.peretarres.org/"target="_blank">Pere Tarrés</a> to obtain the title of director of <i>lleure</i>.</p>
